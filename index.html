            </p>Hello, my name is Jordan. I'm a sophmore from the University of Florida who is currently majoring in computer science. My professional career goal is to become a software engineer at a tech company, and work my way up through the company. I currently have beginner experience in languages including Python and HTMl, and I am open to learning any new languages to may come to me. Dating back to my childhood in Broward County, Florida, I have always been a competitive person up for a good challenge, and this has lead me to being a very motivated person who is always willing to learn more. If you are interested in connecting with me more, I always respond promptly on my Linkedin account.
